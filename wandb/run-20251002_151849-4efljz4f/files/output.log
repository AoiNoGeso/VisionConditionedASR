[Setup] Initializing model...
Some weights of Wav2Vec2Model were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h and are newly initialized: ['masked_spec_embed']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
Some weights of Wav2Vec2ForCTC were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h and are newly initialized: ['wav2vec2.masked_spec_embed']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.52, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.
